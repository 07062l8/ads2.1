# **ADS Assignment 2**
This project contains implementations of several foundational data structures in Java without using the built-in collections framework (except for the Iterator interface). The solution is divided into multiple Java files, each demonstrating a specific data structure or logical structure. The project is built from scratch and includes sorting, searching, and manipulation functionalities.
## **Program Features**

1.`MyList.java`	Interface defining the common functionalities for all list-based structures.

2.`MyArrayList.java`	Dynamic array-backed list implementation.

3.`MyLinkedList.java`	Doubly linked list implementation with safe pointer management.

4.`MyStack.java`	Stack implementation built on top of MyArrayList.

5.`MyQueue.java`	Queue implementation built on top of MyLinkedList.

6.`MyMinHeap.java`	Min-Heap implementation using MyArrayList as the underlying structure.

7.`Test.java`	A test harness to demonstrate and verify the functionality of all classes.
